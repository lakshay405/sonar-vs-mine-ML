Sonar Object Classification using Machine Learning
This project involves using machine learning techniques to classify objects detected by sonar into two categories: "Rock" and "Mine". The classification is based on sonar data features extracted from the dataset.

Dataset
The dataset (data.csv) used in this project contains sonar signals reflected from various objects in the ocean. Each object is classified as either a "Rock" (R) or a "Mine" (M) based on its acoustic properties.

Workflow
Data Loading and Exploration:

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame (sonar_data), where each row represents a sonar signal sample.
Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) includes displaying the first few rows, checking dataset dimensions, statistical summary, and class distribution.
Data Preparation:

The dataset is separated into features (X), which are the acoustic properties of the sonar signals, and target labels (y), which indicate whether each object is a "Rock" or a "Mine".
Model Training and Evaluation:

The data is split into training and test sets using stratified sampling to preserve class proportions.
Two models are trained and evaluated:
Linear Regression: Used as a baseline model for comparison.
Logistic Regression: Applied for binary classification of objects into "Rock" or "Mine".
The accuracy of the logistic regression model is evaluated on the training data.
Prediction:

A predictive system is built to classify new input data.
Example input data, representing acoustic features of an object, is provided to predict whether it is a "Rock" or a "Mine".
The prediction result is displayed along with a corresponding interpretation.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn (sklearn)
Usage
Ensure Python and necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) are installed.
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
Place your dataset (data.csv) in the project directory.
Run the script sonar_classification.py to load the dataset, train the classification models, and classify new objects based on their acoustic features.
Example
Upon running the script, you can input acoustic features of an object and receive a classification prediction ("Rock" or "Mine"). The model leverages logistic regression to perform accurate binary classification based on the acoustic properties extracted from sonar signals.
